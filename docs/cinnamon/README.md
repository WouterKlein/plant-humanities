### The cinnamon challenge

In 2012-2013, the ‘cinnamon challenge’ was a short-lived internet hype. Although the instructions were simple enough – try to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon at once – they proved to be virtually impossible to follow in practice. Trying to ingest dry, ground cinnamon bark initially causes a severe choke reaction, characterised by extreme exhalation of cinnamon powder (known as ‘dragon breath’). Subsequently, the cinnamon combines with saliva in the mouth to produce an indigestible clutter at the back of the throat. Thankfully, this [quite dangerous assignment](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-3418) will only be a marginal footnote to the history of cinnamon. Those who know cinnamon only from an endless series of ridiculous YouTube videos that tried to capture the ‘cinnamon challenge’ or as a quotidian kitchen spice will be surprised to learn that the real challenge has been an ongoing effort, to find out what cinnamon actually is, as a plant and as a medicine.

### Forgotten knowledge and fabricated history

Cinnamon had a long history before any European ever saw ‘true’ cinnamon (_Cinnamomum verum_ J.Presl), which originally grew only on Sri Lanka. Here lies the key to understanding the history of cinnamon: it is mostly about a plant-based product carrying that name, not about any particular plant species like the one mentioned above. This is a crucial point, because a lot of confusion about cinnamon emanates from the incorrectly equating _names_ with _plants_. To be more precise: in the Latin West, it has long been assumed that the plants _cinnamomum_ (κιννάμωμον in Greek) and _cassia_ (κασία), as described by ancient medical authorities (notably Dioscorides), are the same plants as those found in the East Indies in the sixteenth century. A recent revaluation of archaeological, historical, linguistic and botanical evidence, however, suggests that the cinnamon of ancient history was probably an East-African plant, _Cassia abbreviata_ Oliv., which is not related to the genus _Cinnamomum_.[^ref1]

How could this confusion last so long? One possible explanation for the shift from an East-African to a South-East-Asian plant is linguistic. In medieval Latin, the name for cinnamon from the East Indies was _canella_, which still resounds in many European languages today. For some reason, the names _canella_ and _cinnamomum_ both began to be associated with the East Indian spice in the Middle Ages.[^ref2] In the wake of the European voyages of discovery in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, European scholars writing about cinnamon would turn to classical, not medieval sources, to understand the spice and its properties. They managed to resolve the discrepancies they found between classical descriptions of the spice and the plant that was found in Sri Lanka. For instance, in his book [_Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India_](http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/vester/content/pageview/4968642) (1563), the Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta, who worked in Goa, explained the differences between his own observations and classical authors’ descriptions of cinnamon by the fact that the latter had only known the processed spice, not the plant itself.[^ref3]

Another, much more surprising reason for the long-lasting confusion over cinnamon, is the fact that the exact same issue still exists today. This is a striking case of forgotten knowledge in modern science. In the nineteenth century, Friedrich A. Flückiger and Daniel Hanbury already noted in their [_Pharmacographia_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/111743#page/490/mode/1up) (1874) that cinnamon in antiquity did not come from Sri Lanka. It only became a noticeable export item there in the thirteenth century, when political power on the island shifted to the cinnamon-producing areas in the southwest.[^ref4] Rather, they argued, it must have been _cassia lignea_– a common historical name for _cassia_, generally believed to be _Cinnamomum cassia_ (L.) J.Presl – imported from China through Arabia and East Africa. Although this narrative is debatable, it is still more plausible than the one proposed by J. Innes Miller (1969). Miller claimed there had been an interoceanic Spice Route in antiquity, spanning all corners of the Indian Ocean. Although this idea is now rejected by historians, Sri Lanka still features in many accounts of cinnamon in antiquity.[^ref5]

### Cinnamon as a tool of empire

The attraction of cinnamon – ‘true’ or other – as a means to enhance the power of state by displaying its control over exotic riches, predates the early modern period. For example, many coins from the reign of Roman emperor Trajan (r. 98-117 CE) show a personification of Arabia, who holds a bundle of cinnamon sticks. This motif can be associated with Trajan’s conquests on the eastern periphery of the Roman empire, which he managed to extend briefly unto the Persian Gulf. Such coins served as propaganda, emphasizing the empire’s authority over the conquered lands.[^ref7]

The quest for spices, cinnamon among them, was one important aim that inspired Europeans of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to brave the oceans. Columbus, expecting to reach India, brought samples of cinnamon bark with him on his first journey to the Americas to help native inhabitants guide him to cinnamon trees, which he believed should grow there. He sent samples of a kind of ‘white cinnamon’ – probably _Canella winterana_ (L.) Gaertn. – back to Spain from his second journey. Similarly, Juan Sebastián Elcano, who completed Magellan’s circumnavigation of the world after his commander had been killed on the Philippines, successfully petitioned the king to have cinnamon sticks, cloves and nutmeg depicted on his coat-of-arms to commemorate his role in opening up the spice route to the East Indies.[^ref6]

Once ‘true’ cinnamon had begun to be understood as cinnamon from Sri Lanka, European states strove to gain a foothold on the island, to get access to the cinnamon trade. From the sixteenth century onwards, local rulers bargained with the Portuguese, and later the Dutch, for a share in this trade, in exchange for political and military assistance against their rivals. The Portuguese made tentative attempts to create a monopoly after they first arrived on Sri Lanka in 1505. They soon realized that this was impossible without getting involved in local politics on the island. Therefore, they engaged in ‘reluctant imperialism’ to get access to cinnamon: they needed a permanent presence on the island, and eventually signed an agreement with the king of Kotte in 1533 to buy large amounts of cinnamon.[^ref8]

### Optimizing the monopoly

The Dutch made even stronger, concerted efforts to get a monopoly on cinnamon. They signed a treaty with the king of Kandy in 1638, hoping this would give them a share of the cinnamon trade, which was still dominated by the Portuguese at the time. After the Portuguese defeats at Colombo (1656) and Jaffnapatnam (1658), the Dutch controlled many coastal areas of the island, while the kingdom of Kandy ruled the island’s interior. The relation between the Dutch and the king of Kandy was strained. Cinnamon trees were scattered throughout the island’s forests, so groups of cinnamon peelers who worked for the Dutch often had to cross Portuguese as well as Kandian territory to reach the areas where the trees grew. As it was impossible for the Dutch to keep a military grip on this enormous territory, or to control individual groups of peelers, there was little that they could do when the peelers chose, or were forced, to switch allegiance. Therefore, bribing the king of Kandy was a recurring means to make sure he left the peelers alone, in order not to interrupt the supply of cinnamon.

Cinnamon peelers were specialized laborers from the Sinhalese caste _Salagama_ (also known as _Saliya_ or _Chaliya_). Although their skills were indispensable for the cinnamon trade, they were treated harshly by the Dutch. Each year, the peelers gathered in Colombo for a ceremony where they pledged loyalty to the Dutch governor. There was a long peeling season for cinnamon between May and August, and a short season in January and February. On both occasions, groups of men were sent off into the woods with nothing but paring knives and a supply of rice. Adult men were obliged to bring back 12 _robes_ (56 pounds each) at the end of the summer season. Boys from age twelve had to contribute proportionally. Dutch sources often complained about the peelers as being lazy and unreliable, but these workers had a hard life. They were away from home for months, had to provide for themselves while working in the forests, where they were afflicted by diseases, and they were severely punished if they did not meet their quotas.[^ref9]

The restrictions imposed by the Dutch on cinnamon exports made it the only real monopoly on Sri Lanka in the early modern period. Smuggling was severely punished. In 1704, Bengali traders were allowed to export small amounts of cinnamon, which would not affect the monopoly of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) too much. In the 1720s, export restrictions were loosened for several products, but not cinnamon.[^ref10] The tight grip of the Dutch over this trade was also felt internally. Cinnamon harvesters had long been accustomed to clearing plots of forest to create temporary cultivated fields called _chenas_. Under Dutch rule, they were no longer allowed to practice crop rotation on plots planted with cinnamon, so as not to diminish the total acreage. But Pieter van Dam, long-term secretary of the VOC, calculated around 1700 that Sri Lanka produced more than enough cinnamon to supply European and international markets. This makes the suppression of _chena_ practices seem all the more exploitative.[^ref11]

Local grievances about the VOC policy for _chenas_, and about extortion of peelers by Sinhalese and Dutch officials, exploded in 1760. Backed by the king of Kandy, the peelers rebelled, leading to a war that lasted until 1766. The war finally may have caused the Dutch to rethink their approach for cinnamon production. Starting in 1769, governor Iman Willem Falck (in office 1765-1785) began to experiment with ‘cinnamon gardens’ (_kaneeltuinen_), which amounted to nothing less than a successful colonial plantation mechanism. By the end of his governorship, there were 24 million cinnamon trees growing in gardens, which increased to 609 million trees (!) by 1794.[^ref12]

The success was short-lived, however. When the British took over control of the Dutch territories on Sri Lanka in 1796, they failed to maintain the success of the cinnamon plantation economy. Calls for free trade and better working conditions for peelers, high export duties, and competition of cheaper _cassia_ cinnamon from Java finally led to reforms in 1833. But the measures came too late and were counterproductive: Britain sold many plantations to private owners, who switched to coffee and tea production, thus ending the success of cinnamon production for years to come.[^ref13]

### A tool of empire or a tool of science?

Although cinnamon was a successful monopoly during the Dutch period, was it purely a tool of empire? Production and export were guarded as closely as possible, smuggling was prohibited, and living trees could not leave the island. The Dutch monopoly was about retaining commercial interests above anything else, but not all restrictions were commercially motivated. When the commander of the Dutch possessions on the Malabar coast, Hendrik Adriaan van Rheede tot Drakenstein, experimented with the oil of local cinnamon species as a medicine in 1675, he was reprimanded by Rijckloff van Goens, the governor of Sri Lanka, for breaking the monopoly. The colonial government in Batavia agreed, but Van Rheede justified his actions by letter and continued his work. Here, the motivation of both men was to demonstrate that the medicines from ‘their’ respective regions were superior. In such instances, interests of empire and personal rivalry intertwined.[^ref14]

Interests of empire and a disinterested search for knowledge could go hand in hand. The botanist Paul Hermann was employed by the VOC between 1672 and 1677 to gather botanical knowledge on Sri Lanka. Although Hermann barely made it out of Colombo, he managed to collect an impressive amount of material, including many cinnamon specimens.[^ref15] Hermann’s collections offered input for decades of scholarly interest in Sri Lankan flora. Many specimens served indirectly as type specimens for the _Species Plantarum_ (1753) of Carl Linnaeus, who dreamed of transplanting cinnamon to Lapland.[^ref16] But Hermann already knew that northern Europe was too cold for cinnamon: in spite of the VOC ban on exporting living plants, he sent trees to several acquaintances in the Dutch Republic, none of which survived the cold winters.[^ref17] Exchange of knowledge and goods was evidently possible: an extensive, first-hand account of all the cinnamon varieties on Sri Lanka even made it into the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society in 1730.[^ref18]

### Cinnamon and the imagination of empire

Meanwhile, other states were desperate to have cinnamon for themselves. This was especially true for Spain and its empire. Spain tried – ultimately with no success – to acquire cinnamon trees itself, or at least to copy Dutch practices for exotic plants in its colonies.[^ref19] The Spanish quest for cinnamon in the New World even went back as far as the early days of exploration: we already came across Columbus’s efforts to find cinnamon on his journeys. The famous expedition of Gonzalo Pizarro and Francisco de Orellana along the Amazon river (1541-1542) was also intended to find the legendary ‘Land of Cinnamon’ (_País de la Canela_), which was associated with the land of gold, El Dorado. Their journey still inspired the French botanist Joseph de Jussieu to find the cinnamon lands of South America in the 1740s.[^ref20]

The Spanish efforts to find cinnamon in the New World were not only intended to compete with the ‘true’ cinnamon of the Portuguese and the Dutch on Sri Lanka. There was more at stake. The commercial successes of Spain’s European rivals in the East Indies made the Cape of Good Hope the principal shipping route to get there. The promise of South American riches could transform Cape Horn into an attractive alternative route, which would benefit Spain. This was an important aim for men like Alonso de Ovalle, a Chilean Jesuit. His _Histórica Relación del Reyno de Chile_ (1646) was accompanied by a detailed map, which served as a visual propaganda tool for Spanish South America. The map highlights the assets of the continent, including the presence of _<span data-click-image-zoomto="6423,1032,659,467">canela</span>_ and _<span data-click-image-zoomto="7756,2229,613,434">cynamomum</span>_ areas along the east coast.[^ref21] This was one strategy to emphasize the possibilities of cinnamon production for the Spanish global empire.

And Spain really needed cinnamon. One eighteenth-century report estimated that two-thirds of the Dutch cinnamon exports from Sri Lanka to Europe was consumed by Spain and its colonies.[^ref22] It still wasn’t enough. Cinnamon was used, for instance, as a flavoring ingredient in chocolate drinks, which were very popular in the Spanish Atlantic world.[^ref23] To supplement the supply of cinnamon, Spain embarked on a second strategy of producing cinnamon itself, from other _Cinnamomum_ species in the East Indies. Thus, plantations were created in the Philippines, planted with local species like _Cinnamomum burmanni_ (Nees & T.Nees) Blume and _Cinnamomum cebuense_ Kosterm.[^ref24] The Spanish pharmacist and botanist Juan de Cuéllar went at lengths to convince his superiors in Madrid that cinnamon from the Philippines was identical to cinnamon from Sri Lanka. This was not only a scholarly motivated exercise: there were important commercial interests at stake if Spanish cinnamon could be equated with Dutch cinnamon.[^ref25]

A third, and most daring strategy, was to transplant the ‘true’ cinnamon to Spanish territories. This was an important objective for men like Casimiro Gómez Ortega, director of the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid between 1771 and 1801, and José Celestino Mutis, the Spanish botanist who initiated the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada from 1783 onwards. Gómez Ortega published an instruction in 1779, which invited naturalists everywhere to contribute plants and plant knowledge for the Spanish empire. Cinnamon was explicitly mentioned as one of the target species. Similarly, Mutis addressed the Spanish crown in the 1760s to support his plans for botanical expeditions in South America. New plant knowledge would greatly benefit the empire, and again cinnamon was explicitly mentioned.[^ref26] However, Spain never succeeded in growing ‘true’ cinnamon in South America, contrary to the French on Guadeloupe (1762) and the British on Saint Vincent (1768).[^ref27]

But confusion still remains: _Cinnamomum verum_ J.Presl is now grown in many countries in the tropical zone, but the quality of the product differs for each region.[^ref28] Moreover, commercial statistics usually generalize all market variations under the header ‘cinnamon’, without differentiating between _Cinnamomum_ species. This issue is even more pertinent in medicine. Cinnamon has a lot of potential therapeutic applications that have been studied, but many studies fail to clarify which species of _Cinnamomum_ was/were used, making it difficult to generalize the results.[^ref29] The species epithet _verum_ may sound like an obsolete name in a globalized world, where everyone has access to cinnamon and where cinnamon is grown in many tropical areas. But it still captures the essence of what cinnamon has always been about: distinguishing between what is ‘true’ and what is not.

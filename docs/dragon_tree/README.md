### Introduction: a desensitizing sensory experience
As the tongue goes numb and all efforts fail to remove the scarlet, sticky substance that binds to one’s teeth like quick-setting epoxy, one starts to panic and wonder if the dragon’s blood they just ingested is truly as noxious as its name suggests. Though the epithet ‘dragon’s blood’ brings forth images of medieval myths and fantastical notions of fire-breathing lizards soaring high in the sky, this ‘blood’ is in fact the resin of a very real tree. Dragon trees have thick trunks and distinctive, umbrella-style crowns. They captured the imaginations of great minds across the ages, from Pliny the Elder (d. 79 CE) in to Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859). Unlike Pliny, however, who was the lone scholar of his age enthralled by the epic allure of the dragon tree, Enlightenment era European naturalists like Humboldt and André Pierre Ledru (1761-1825) focused on one species, _Dracaena draco_ (L.) L., and both flocked to its native Canary Islands to study it around the turn of the nineteenth century. Soon after their initial encounters with dragon’s blood, they all may have realized that this strange sap occupied a liminal space between myth, legend, and scientific botany.

### Sanguine myths and elemental reality
Members of today’s _Dracaena_ genus have long been valued for their signature red resin, dragon’s blood, that oozes from cuts in the bark of those trees. Though the focus of this article is on _D. draco_ , there are many other species of tree that exude their own forms of dragon’s blood. These include the other 120 members of the _Dracaena_ genus, in addition to several others. While these other trees certainly exude a resin identified as dragon’s blood, a level of botanical and geographical ambiguity that contributes to the mythical status of the substance, _D. draco_ and _D. cinnabari_ are the two species that are most commonly referred to as the source of the resin in historical sources. The first known reports of dragon’s blood were dispersed through Pliny’s [_Naturalis Historia_](https://archive.org/details/OEXV10R/mode/2up), where he recounted the Indian tale of a dragon (representing Brahma) biting a giant elephant (representing Shiva) and their blood mixing into the iconic resin. While this Vedic myth actually originates from Socotra island of Yemen and is based on the resin of _Dracaena cinnabari_, the fascination with dragon’s blood also took a foothold in Europe through the infamous tale of Hercules.[^ref1]

As the eleventh labor of his famous twelve, Hercules was sent to steal the golden apples guarded by Ladon, a vicious dragon with one hundred heads. Once slain by the demigod, Ladon’s blood seeped into the ground and “from it sprung up the trees that we now know as ‘dragon trees,’” and his body was sent to live among the stars.[^ref2] As dragon’s blood soon became one of the most coveted commodities in ancient Greece, so too did it serve as a lasting link between myth and reality, as Greeks from Athens to Thebes believed that “the source of ‘Dragon’s Blood’ [... is] the red blood of the dragon Ladon after it was killed by Hercules.”[^ref3]

### Dragon trees of the Canaries
As the myths of Antiquity and legends surrounding the dragon tree aged with time, so too did European understandings of the tree evolve as scientific botany developed from the late medieval through the early modern period. Native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Madeira, and recently found growing natively on the West coast of Morocco, _D. draco_ is somewhat ubiquitous along the Northwestern coast of Africa. Evidently, the tree and its resin were an important feature of the economy and magico-medicine of the Canary Islands even before colonial contact. Thus, when French explorer Jean de Béthencourt became the first European to write of _D. draco_ in 1402, he recounted an elaborate trade of fishing hooks, knives, and iron in exchange for figs and dragon’s blood between his crew and 500 Guanches, the indigenous population of the Canary Islands.[^ref4]

The Guanches used dragon’s blood for a variety of purposes, ranging from embalming their dead, making dyes and varnishes, to using it as a toothpaste.[^ref5]  Believing that, when dragons died, they transformed into the divine trees, Guanches would regularly meet under the Orotava giant dragon tree’s large canopy to enact laws and perform judicial duties, as well as base meteorological predictions on the tree’s bloom.[^ref6] The tree remained a mythic indicator of foreign land that was both exotically enticing yet materially valuable, as shown, for instance, in Martin Schongauer’s engraving _The Flight to Egypt_ (c. 1470). Dragon’s blood was immensely valuable: Béthencourt noted that the resin was “well worth two hundred ducats, while what was given in exchange was hardly worth two francs.”[^ref7] In fact, dragon’s blood soon became a European toothpaste, likely indicating a cultural transference of ethnobotanical knowledge between the Guanches and their European neighbors.

### Dragon's blood: from herbals to Enlightenment science
After decades of violent attacks against the Guanches, Spanish conquistadors finally vanquished the last of the Canary Islands in 1496. The Guanche language soon disappeared, with the exception of their distinct whistling language, known as Silbo Gomero <param ve-audio url="https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/raw/master/media/Silbo%20(online-audio-converter.com).mp3">. Due to the traditional Western preference for written records rather than oral histories, much of what we now know of pre-Columbian culture on the Canaries comes from European colonial interlocutors.

Throughout its dissemination into European spaces from the Age of Discovery, dragon’s blood was understood chiefly as a medicament. Soon after its introduction, the sticky scarlet resin became nothing short of a panacea with widespread potential to prevent a host of illnesses.[^ref8] As a result, the so-called ‘_draco arbor_’ features in famous early modern herbals, such as John Gerard’s [_Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/33580#page/1/mode/1up) (1633) and John Parkinson’s [_Theatrum Botanicum_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/256142#page/13/mode/1up) (1640). Both authors pointed to the Atlantic islands (comprised of the Canary Islands, as well as the Portuguese Azores and Madeira) as the tree’s most common habitat. As for _D. draco_’s medical uses, Gerard and Parkinson also agreed: its resin was believed to have effective astringent properties to treat gonorrhea, dysentery, spitting blood, and loose teeth. Gerard noted that “smiths also use it to varnish over their works,” while Parkinson doubted “painters can bring it to be a fit color to be used in their works.”[^ref9]

After European colonization, and along with the integration of the Canaries into the burgeoning European sphere of influence, _D. draco_ emerged on the stage of European gardens. Botanical interest in _D. draco_ thrived especially in the latter half of the eighteenth century. German scientist and writer Alexander von Humboldt famously fell prey to the tree’s enchanting appeal. In [_Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/73496#page/7/mode/1up) (1842), his last work, he still recalled the time when, as a child, he “first saw a colossal dragon tree in an old tower of the Botanical Garden in Berlin.”[^ref10] The experience was so overwhelming that Humboldt even thought of it as “the source from whence sprang my early and fixed desire to visit the lands of the tropics.”[^ref11] The fact that the dragon tree bookended Humboldt’s illustrious career, as both a formative experience of his youth and a notable point in his last great work highlights how the dragon tree itself was at the core of his understanding of nature as one interconnected whole.

In 1799, as he stopped in Tenerife before his voyage to the Americas that would make him world-famous, Humboldt found himself in the village of Orotava. There, he entered the garden of a Monsieur Franchy and was immediately awe-struck by the sheer size and magnitude of the dragon tree there – the very same tree that the Guanches had worshipped for centuries. He reported it to measure 60 feet tall and 45 feet in circumference near the roots. “We were told that the trunk of this tree,” Humboldt wrote in his [_Personal Narrative_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/228502#page/5/mode/1up), “which is mentioned in several ancient documents as marking the boundaries of a field, was as gigantic in the fifteenth century as it is at the present time.” According to his calculations, the specimen was undoubtedly “one of the oldest inhabitants in our world,” which called for special protection.[^ref12] Humboldt’s experience with the large _D. draco_ at Orotava was far more than the mere realization of a boyish dream, but was instead a pioneering act that that inspired other European travelers to follow in his footsteps and help strengthen a global network of scientific and economic exchanges focused on plants.

### Smothering the dragon's flame: _D. draco_ and the Anthropocene
Humboldt was not the only naturalist of his time attracted to the remarkable centenary dragon tree, as some three years before, in 1796, French naturalist André Pierre Ledru also found himself in M. Franchy’s garden, admiring the very same tree. The scarlet-colored resin was a critical aspect of the Guanche pharmacopoeia and a valuable piece of _naturalia_ that spurred the Canarian economy. By the turn of the nineteenth century, however, due to unsustainable cultivation techniques, the population of trees from which it was sourced was already in decline. This environmental degradation has only increased in intensity in the last two centuries with the intensification of human-driven ecological change, known as the Anthropocene.

As Ledru remarked in his 1810 [_Voyages aux îles de Ténériffe, la Trinité, Saint-Thomas, Sainte-Croix et Porto-Ricco_](https://archive.org/details/voyageauxlesdet00sonngoog/page/n5/mode/2up), which drew on observations he made during his trip to the Isles of Fortune some fourteen years earlier: “In days gone by, the resin that one extracts from the dragon tree was an important object of commerce for Teneriffe; but since the locals have neglected to replace the old trees that were worn out by too-frequent tapping (of the resin) with young plantations, this source will soon be exhausted. There exist perhaps less than fifty dragon trees left on the island.”[^ref13] This gradual, yet persistent, degradation of the _D. draco_ population was not solely due to Guanche overcultivation, either, as Spanish colonizers inflicted profound ecological changes upon the islands when they razed and destroyed large swaths of forests during their conquest and settlement of the Canaries three centuries earlier.[^ref14] Modern ecologists attribute the dragon tree’s decline to the disappearance of seed dispersers in the Canary Islands over the _longue durée_, potentially refuting Ledru’s assertion that _D. draco_’s deterioration was due to irresponsible Guanche farming practices.[^ref15]

But even in the face of this acute anthropogenic pressure, the great dragon tree at Orotava persisted. Struck by the tree’s size, age, and enduring spirit, Ledru remarks on how even the most environmentally malicious conquistadors respected this dragon tree. Perhaps, then, to Humboldt’s delight, Ledru estimated that this special tree would easily live another one-hundred-fifty to two-hundred years.[^ref16]
<param ve-storiiies
	id="7b1dr">

Unfortunately, the Orotava centenary dragon tree did not outlive Humboldt and Ledru’s visits by too long. In 1819, a storm first cut off one of its branches, and in 1867, a hurricane-like tempest broke them all off.[^ref17] Despite this inauspicious demise, the tree’s image remains associated with the Canary Islands today, and it is still frequently featured prominently in images of Orotava. Furthermore, both naturalists’ accounts of their encounters with the dragon tree in its native environment stand as proof of its power to equally excite scientific and aesthetic imagination, promote environmental concerns, and reinforce colonial dynamics.

Just as Humboldt and Ledru observed the centenary _D. draco_ at Orotava and pondered the tree’s age, durability, and its potential influence on theories of a global climate, today’s scientists are weighing the tree’s possible medicinal benefits (including potential cancer treatments) and its commercial value in the cosmetics industry as an ingredient in anti-aging creams in relation to the species’ ongoing battle with extinction and its ecological vulnerability.[^ref18] Since many different species make good sources of what is commonly known as dragon’s blood, more comprehensive research still needs to be carried out to fully assess the mythical resin’s true medicinal efficacy.[^ref19]

Today, _D. draco_ is officially designated as a vulnerable population on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s _Red List of Threatened Species_ due to its near-extinction in the wild.[^ref20] This is due in part to the fact that the tree relies on animals to disperse its seeds, and the number of suitable animal dispersers has substantially decreased over time due to hunting and other forms of habitat destruction.[^ref21] Furthermore, as Ledru noted over two centuries ago, this population decline and endangerment is also due to overcultivation of the tree’s valuable resin. The number of wild specimens has never been lower than it is today, and even though there are projects to repopulate the islands through experiments in propagation and acclimatization, one wonders if ever again a _Dracaena draco_ will grow to the size and magnificence of the one that so captivated the minds of travelers like Humboldt and Ledru.[^ref22] Perhaps, after its millennia-long smolder, the dragon’s flame will finally be snuffed out by the twenty-first century Anthropocene. Or, perhaps, ecological preservation projects may reverse the trajectory of this ailing species.
